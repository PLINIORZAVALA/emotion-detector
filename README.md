# Real-Time Emotion Detection using CNN and OpenCV

This project implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on the FER2013 dataset, combined with face detection using OpenCV and dynamic emotion visualization with Matplotlib.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using OpenCV with SSD ResNet model.
- Facial emotion classification into 7 classes:  
  `angry`, `disgust`, `fear`, `happy`, `neutral`, `sad`, `surprise`.
- Real-time emotion probabilities visualized in a dynamic Matplotlib bar chart.
- Display of the dominant emotion with percentage and current FPS on-screen.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.3 or higher  
- Webcam (built-in or USB)  
- Recommended: TensorFlow CPU/GPU and Matplotlib

## Installation and Running

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/emotion-detector.git
cd emotion-detector
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv310
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

* On **Linux/macOS**:

```bash
source venv310/bin/activate
```

* On **Windows (PowerShell)**:

```bash
venv310\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ðŸ’¡ If you have a CUDA-capable GPU, consider installing `tensorflow-gpu` for better performance.

### 5. Run the application

```bash
python main.py
```

Press `q` in the OpenCV window to stop the camera and close the program.

## Models Used

* **Face detector**: Pre-trained `ResNet SSD` (Single Shot Multibox Detector) from OpenCV using the Caffe framework.
* **Emotion classifier**: Custom CNN trained on the FER2013 dataset, loaded from JSON and `.h5` weights.

---

## Visualization

* A **bounding box** with the predicted emotion and its confidence is shown around each detected face.
* A **bar chart** is updated in real time, showing the probability for each of the 7 emotions.
