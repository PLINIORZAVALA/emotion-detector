# Real-Time Emotion Detection using CNN and OpenCV

This project implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on the FER2013 dataset. It combines OpenCV for face detection and Matplotlib for live emotion probability visualization.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using OpenCV and SSD model (Caffe).
- Emotion classification: `angry`, `disgust`, `fear`, `happy`, `neutral`, `sad`, `surprise`.
- Live Matplotlib bar chart showing emotion probabilities.
- FPS and emotion label overlay on webcam video.

---

## Requirements

- Python **3.10.11**
- Windows 10/11 (tested on PowerShell)
- Working webcam
- Virtual environment (`venv`)

---

## Installation and Running (Windows 10/11)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/emotion-detector.git
cd emotion-detector
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv venv310
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

```powershell
.\venv310\Scripts\Activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you're not using a GPU, TensorFlow will fall back to CPU. You can ignore `cudart64_110.dll` or `nvcuda.dll` warnings unless you're setting up CUDA.

### 5. Run the system

```bash
python main.py
```

Press `q` to exit the camera feed.

## Models Used

* **Face Detector**: `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel` based on Single Shot Detector with Caffe.
* **Emotion Detector**: Custom CNN model using a `BlurLayer`, trained on FER2013 dataset.

  * `67emotion_human.json` – model architecture
  * `67emotion_human.h5` – model weights

---

## Visualization

* Detected faces are outlined with bounding boxes and labeled with the predicted emotion + confidence.
* A real-time **bar chart** shows the probabilities of all 7 emotions per frame.

---

## Windows-Specific Notes

* Webcam initialized with `cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)` for better compatibility.
* Run from PowerShell or CMD, not from within VS Code’s Run button.
* Ensure no other app is using the webcam.
* TensorFlow CPU is used by default; no GPU or CUDA is required.
